# This is a tracker and statistics calculator for the TV show "Are you the one?"

## Rules  of the show

The show is **highly trashy** and I wouldn't 
recommend it to anyone who likes interesting 
conversations. But looking from a mathematical 
perspective it is very interesting:

### Setting

10 persons from one hetero normative gender 
and 11 from the other are placed int a villa 
and have a predefined "perfect match" which 
they have to find. (one triple match included)

They only win the show - and the prize money - 
if everyone finds their match.

... But matches can only be identified by two methods:

### Matchbox (max 10)

The candidates vote one pair to go in the "Matchbox". 
Then they get a straight answer afterward: **Match** 
or **No Match**.

### Matching night

The candidates group themselves into 10 pairs leaving 
one person alone. After that *n* lights turn on. The *n* 
signals how many perfect matches there are in the 10 pairs.

If they don't have 10 lights being turned on in the 10th night 
they lose the show.

## How to set up (for people that have never used GitHub, python or anything related to coding)

Since this project only exists because my friend 
wanted to know the outcome of her favourite show 
before other people I assume there are more people 
like her - who don't know a bit about code - 
I made this detailed step-by-step guide.

### Downloads

git, python, etc.
